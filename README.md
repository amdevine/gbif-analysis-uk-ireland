# Analysis of Families in the UK and Ireland

This repository contains an example analysis of taxonomic families found in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) and Ireland. 

## Analysis Workflow

The Jupyter notebook **UK Ireland Analysis.ipynb** contains the workflow for processing and manipulating GBIF data. This notebook assumes that data were downloaded from GBIF and GGBN prior to running the analysis (see Data Sources). The output map of family richness was produced separately from this workflow, using data produced by this workflow (see Output Map).

### Data Sources

GBIF data were downloaded from GBIF Occurrence records: https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search

GGBN data were downloaded via the GGBN Data Portal API: http://data.ggbn.org/ggbn_portal/api/  
Detailed instructions on querying the GGBN Data Portal API are available here: https://gist.github.com/amdevine/b21ca15fcfaac5c1e75fc33fdcde4056

CoL data were downloaded from the CoL Darwin Core Archive Export repository: http://www.catalogueoflife.org/DCA_Export/archive.php

### Output Map

The map produced in this analysis was created by hand using Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/), a free vector image creation program. For more complex mapping tasks, dedicated mapping or GIS software is recommended, such as ArcGIS, QGIS (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), or Tableau (https://www.tableau.com/).
